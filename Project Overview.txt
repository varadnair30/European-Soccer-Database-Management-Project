
Project Overview
----------------
This project encompasses the creation, manipulation, and validation of a database for European soccer. The tasks include schema design, data insertion, and integrity constraint testing within an Oracle database environment.

1. Database Schema Creation
Procedure:-
The tables for the SOCCER database were created using SQL scripts stored in a text file, executed through SQL*Plus. This part of the project was documented by capturing the SQL commands and their execution in a spool file.
Spool Output for Table Creation (Q1.txt)


2. Schema Diagram (Q2.png)
The schema diagram visualizes the relationships and structure of the database, illustrating how the tables are interconnected through various keys and constraints.

3. Data Loading
Using Java programs, records from provided CSV files were loaded into each corresponding table in the database. These programs used JDBC to establish a connection with the Oracle database and execute SQL insert commands.
Also, ojdbc JAR is also used.

Data Loading Scripts:-

LoadCountryData.java
LoadLeagueData.java
LoadMatchData.java
LoadPATable.java
LoadPlayerData.java
LoadTeamAttribute.java
LoadTeamData.java

4. Integrity Constraint Violation Tests 
A series of SQL INSERT commands were deliberately designed to violate different types of integrity constraints to test the database schema's robustness (spool file -> Q4.txt)

Primary Key Violation(Key Constraints Violation):

insert into country values(1,'Rajat');

ERROR: ORA-00001: unique constraint (RXS8010.SYS_C00857131) violated

Data Type Mismatch(Domain Constraints Violation) :
insert into country values('rajat', 1);

ERROR: ORA-01722: invalid number
Entity Integrity Violation:
insert into country values(NULL,'rajat');
ERROR: ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into ("RXS8010"."COUNTRY"."ID")

All commands and errors were captured in a spool file, ensuring detailed documentation of each test.

5. Deletion of Records Violating Referential Integrity
Attempts to delete records that would cause referential integrity violations were made. The SQL commands and database responses are documented in the spool file(Q5.txt)


6. Valid Record Insertions
Three new records complying with all integrity constraints were successfully inserted into the database. The SQL commands and their execution details are documented in the spool file(Q6.txt)
